# Summary

`OpenCCM` is a compartmental modelling [@Jourdan2019] software package based on recently developed fully automated flow alignment compartmentalization methods [@Vasile2024]. It is primarily intended for large-scale flow-based processes with weak coupling between composition changes, e.g. through (bio)chemical reactions, and convective mass transport in the system. Compartmental modelling is an important approach used to develop reduced-order models [@Chinesta2017] [@Benner2020] using a priori knowledge of process hydrodynamics [@Jourdan2019]. Compartmental modelling methods, such as those implemented in `OpenCCM`, enable simulations of these processes with far less computational complexity while still capturing the key aspects of process dynamics.

`OpenCCM` integrates with two multiphysics simulation software packages, `OpenCMP` [@Monte2022] and `OpenFOAM` [@greenshields2024], allowing for ease of transferring simulation data for compartmentalization. Additionally, it provides users with built-in functionality for computing residence times and exporting for use in other simulation or visualization software, including `ParaView` [@Paraview]. Post-processing methods are included for mapping simulation results from compartment domains to the original simulation domain, which are useful for visualization purposes and for further simulations in using other software (e.g., multi-scale modelling).


# Statement of Need

Simulation-based design and analysis continue to be widely applied in the research and development of physicochemical processes. Processes with large differences in characteristic time and length scales result in the infeasibility of direct multiphysics simulations due to computational limitations. This imposes significant computational costs, which severely reduce the utility of these simulations for entire classes of processes. Compartmental modeling is well-suited for such applications because it enables the generatation of reduced-order models which are less computationally demanding, frequently by orders of magnitude, compared to direct continuum mechanical simulations. This is enabled by taking advantage, when present, of weak couplings between the short and long-time-scale dynamic phenomena.

However, several barriers prevent the more widespread use of compartmental models. The largest of these is the lack of software for automating the generation compartmental models. Closed-source software packages, specifically `AMBER` [@Amber], exists for manually creating and solving well-mixed compartment networks. However, the cost of these packages are prohibitive for much of the research community and it lacks automated compartmentalization. Open-source software, `Cantera` [@Cantera], also exists to solve compartment networks. However, it does not incorporate flow information, when available, either from direct observation or continuum mechanical simulations. Furthermore, neither of these software allow for the usage and direct transfer of flow information from continuum mechanical simulations, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, which are typically feasible over short (hydrodynamic) time scales.

The overall aim of `OpenCCM` is to fill the need for an open-source compartmental modeling package that is user-friendly, compatible with a variety of simulation package back-ends (e.g., `OpenFOAM` and `OpenCMP`), and which fits into the user's existing simulation and post-processing software toolchain, i.e., `ParaView`.

# User Interface

The `OpenCCM` Python package can be used via text-based configuration files centred around the command line interface (CLI), where each simulation run/project is self-contained in a project directory. In addition to the `OpenCCM` configuration files, the required contents include flow information from one of two open-source simulation packages: ``OpenCMP`` or ``OpenFOAM``. For ``OpenCMP`` three files are required:

1) The ``OpenCMP`` config file,
2) The mesh on which the simulation was run, and
3) The .sol solution file containing the velocity profile to create the compartmental model.

For ``OpenFOAM``, two sub-directories are required:

1) The `constant/` directory, which contains the mesh information in ASCII format,
2) A directory containing the simulation results, which will be used to create the compartmental model saved in ASCII format.

The path to the solution directory is specified in the `OpenCCM` configuration file and the `constant/` directory is assumed to be in the same parent folder. `OpenCCM` will create several output directories: `log/`, which contains detailed debugging information (if enabled); `cache/`, which contains intermediary files; and `output_ccm/`, which contains both simulation results of the compartmental model (in various user-specified formats) and `ParaView` files for visualization.

A sample config file, `CONFIG`, which outlines the available parameters, is included in the main directory.
An excerpt of it, showing the compartmental modeling parameters, is shown below.
Square brackets indicate parameters with default values along with those values indicated inside the brackets.

    # below which the flow is considered 0.
    flow_threshold_facet    = [1e-15]

    flow_threshold          = [1e-15]
    # Maximum allowable difference (in % of compartment volume)

    dist_threshold          = [5 / 100]
    # Absolute tolerances for checking that mass is conserved 
    # after the flow optimization is performed.
    atol_opt                = [1e-2]

# Reaction Configuration File

The chemical reaction parser in `OpenCCM` reads and parses the reaction configuration files and can handle general reaction equations of the form,

`aA + bB + [...] -> cC + dD + [...]`

with associated numeric rate constants. It intentionally does not support the standard `<->` symbol for reversible chemical reactions, so that each independent reaction has an explicitly defined rate constant. Therefore, a reversible reaction must be written as two independent forward reactions, each with its own rate constant. Each species *label* can contain letters and numbers, but cannot contain brackets or special characters, e.g. "(", ")", "+", "-", "^", etc. Kinetic rate constants must be expressed as positive real numbers in standard or scientific notation. Additionally, each reaction/rate pair must have a unique *identifier* (i.e., R1, R2). For example, the reversible reaction,

$$2\textrm{NaCl} + \textrm{CaCO}_3 \Leftrightarrow \textrm{Na}_2\textrm{CO}_3 + \textrm{CaCl}_2$$

with $k_f = 5e-2$ and $k_r = 2$ (chosen to be dimensionless for example). A configuration file for this reversible reaction may then be:

    [REACTIONS]
    R1: 2NaCl   + CaCO3 ->  Na2CO3 + CaCl2
    R2:  Na2CO3 + CaCl2 -> 2NaCl   + CaCO3
    
    [RATES]
    R1: 5e-2
    R2: 2

where **R1** and **R2** are the reaction *identifiers* for the forward and reverse reactions, respectively.

An example reaction config file, `CONFIG_REACTIONS`, is provided in the main package directory. 

# Examples of Usage

Several examples are provided in the `OpenCCM` documentation, which demonstrates the using of both `OpenCMP` and `OpenFOAM` simulation-based flow information for compartmentalization. One example, located in `examples/OpenCMP/pipe_with_recird_2d/`, uses the geometry from [@Vasile2024] and shows how to execute the needed CFD simulation for flow information (both using `OpenCMP` and `OpenFOAM`), create/visualize the compartmental model results, and compare the predicted RTD to the reference result directly from CFD simulation.

For this illustrative example, the steady-state hydrodynamic flow-profile is obtained by running the `OpenCMP` simulation through the `run_OpenCMP.py` script in the folder. The resulting flow profile was opened in `ParaView` and a line integral convolution visualization of the velocity field is shown below, coloured by velocity magnitude.

The underlying velocity field data is then processed using `OpenCCM` to generate a network of compartments by executing the `run_compartment.py` script. The figure below shows each element of the original mesh coloured according to the compartment to which it belongs.

![Visualization of flow-informed compartmentalization with coloring corresponding to compartment number.](images/labelled_compartments.png){ width=98% }

That network of compartments is further processed, as each compartment is represented by a series of plug-flow reactors (PFRs). The resulting network (graph) of PFRs is shown in the figure below. Nodes are the centres of the PFRs and edges are connections (flows) between PFRs.

## RTD Curves

The residence time distribution (RTD) curve from both the CFD and compartmental model (CM) simulations is computed using the script in the supplementary material of [@Vasile2024].

![Residence time distribution curves for CFD and CM simulations.](images/cfd_vs_pfr_vs_cstr.pdf){ width=60% }

## Reactions

Finally, to demonstrate how to simulate chemical reaction, an example is included using the reversible reaction system from above:

$$2\textrm{NaCl} + \textrm{CaCO}_3 \Leftrightarrow \textrm{Na}_2\textrm{CO}_3 + \textrm{CaCl}_2$$

with $k_f = 5e-2$ and $k_r = 2$ as the forward and backward rate constants (chosen to be dimensionless for example). All species have an initial dimensionless concentration of $0$ and have inlet boundary dimensionless concentration values of $[\textrm{NaCl}] = [\textrm{CaCO}_3] = 1$ and $[\textrm{Na}_2\textrm{CO}_3] = [\textrm{CaCl}_2] = 0$. The equations and conditions have already been specified, and the simulation can be run by using the `run_compartment_w_rxn.py` script. Note that when this script is run multiple times, computational times following the first will be much shorter in that the compartmental model is pre-computed (stored within the project directory).

To analyze the results, the equilibrium values for this reversible system are calculated as follows:

$$ k_f [\textrm{NaCl}]^2[\textrm{CaCO}_3] = k_r [\textrm{Na}_2\textrm{CO}_3][\textrm{CaCl}_2] $$
$$ \frac{k_f}{k_r} = \frac{[\textrm{Na}_2\textrm{CO}_3][\textrm{CaCl}_2]}{[\textrm{NaCl}]^2[\textrm{CaCO}_3]} $$
$$ \frac{5 \times 10^{-2}}{2} = \frac{(x)(x)}{(1-2x)^2(1-x)} $$
$$ x \approx 0.1147 $$

where `x` is the change in $\textrm{CaCO}_3$, in dimensionless units.

The expected equilibrium concentrations for the four species are: $[NaCl] = 0.7706$, $[CaCO_3] = 0.8853$, $[Na_2CO_3] = 0.1147$, and $[CaCl_2] = 0.1147$. Based on the figures below and from direct inspection of the CM simulation results, correct steady-state values are obtained at the reactor outlet.

To output the `ParaView` visualizations, change `output_VTK` to `True` in the `CONFIG` file and re-run the simulation.
