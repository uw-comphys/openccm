    This function takes identified compartments and converts them into a network of compartments.

    When creating the network, any compartments which are found to have only one connection are removed from the network.

    The resulting compartment network is cleaned up by merging together neighbouring compartments which are below
    a user-specified size threshold.

    Finally, the compartments are renumbered to the range [0, N) in a sequential order without gaps.

    Args:
        compartments:       A list of set. The ith set contains the indices of the elements belonging to the ith compartment.
        mesh:               The mesh from which the compartments were built.
        dir_vec:            Direction vector, NxD where N is the number of mesh elements and D the dimension of the mesh.
        vel_vec:            Velocity vector, NxD where N is the number of mesh elements and D the dimension of the mesh.

                                    and the values are another dictionary.
                                        For each of those dictionaries, the keys are the index of the bounding facet between the two compartments,
                                        and the values are Tuples.
                                            The first entry in the tuple is the index of the element on the boundary inside the compartment.
                                            The second is a numpy array representing the unit normal for that boundary facing out of the compartment.

    Take a set of facets and group them together into several contiguous surfaces.

    Facets are considered as being connected if they share one entity of a dimension lower than them.
    E.g. For a 3D mesh, facets are surfaces. Two facets are considered connected if they share an edge.
    The creation of this connectivity is handled by the creation of the CMesh.
    This function queries the CMesh for which facet(s) a given facet is connected it.

    Args:
        facets: The set of facets to group.
        mesh:   The CMesh on which the facets below. Used to get their connectivity.

    Returns:
        surfaces:   A list of contiguous surfaces, each represented as a list of facet IDs.
